TOKENS in JAVA
K-keywords(int, float, char, double, private, public, if, do,while,protected)
I-identifers
L-literals(constants)
p/s-Punctuations/Seperations
O-operators
Datatypes of java
Primitive-Boolean, Numeric[Character(char), Integral(Integer(byte,short,int,long), Floating point(float,double))]
Non primitive-String, Array etc
Increment and Decrement: Same as c or c++.
Static data member function:
points:-i>Static data members are not part of any object it is the part of the class.
ii.It cannot invoked directly using the class name
iii.Static member function can used only static data member.
Inheritance-
It is always better to use pre existing resource rather than creating all over again.This is done using inheritance.
inheritance provides us a a way using which we can use pre existing resource to our current program.
Benifits: Reusability.
Types of Inheritance:
1)Single Inheritance-When one base class is being derived by a single derived class, then this is called single inheritance.
2)Multiple Inheritance-Java doesn't supprort multiple inheritance.
Why java does not support multiple inheritance?
Ans- Whenever a sub class work to inherit the propertyof two or more super classes that have same method java  complier can't decide which class method it should
inherit.
Then their might be a chance of memory duplication i.e a reason java doesn,t support multiple inheritance through classes.
3)Multilevel Inheritance-When a class inherits in another class and again the another class being inherited by another class,
then this is called multilevel inheritance.
4)Hierarchical Inheritance-Hierarchical Inheritance is a type of inheritance in which one class is derived by multiple classes.
5)HYbrid Inheritance.
To use inheritance in java we have to use 'extends' keyword.
Method Overriding-
When there is same name function in base and derived class, then call and not the base class function. We can say here that the derived class function has overriden 
base class function & this is called Method Overriding.
Final Variable-A final variable is a variable whose value can't be changed during the execution of the program.
Final Method-A final method prevents the method overriding.
Polymorphism-An object having multiple working called polymorphism
Types i)RunTime Polymorphism ii)Compiletime Polymorphism
Encapsulation is a mechanism through which we can wrapping the data members and member function of a class in a single unit called encapsulation.
Abstraction-Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details from the user only the highlighted set of the services provided to the user.
Advantage-i)Security ii)Enhancement
Abstraction types--
i)Abstract class-A class which contains the abstract keyword in its declaration is called abstract class.
We can't create object for abstract class.
We may or may not contain abstract methods.
It can have abstract & non-abstract methods.
To use an abstract class , you have to inherite it from sub class.
If a class contain partial implementation then we should declare a class as abstract.
Abstraction method-A method which contain abstract modifier at the line of declaration is called abstract method.
Note-i)It can only be used in abstract class.
ii)It doesn't contain any body "{}"and always ends with ";".
iii)Abstract method must be overridden in sub classes otherwise it will also become a abstract class
iv)Whenever the action is common but implementation are different then we should use abstract method
**************************************************Interface************************************************
What is interface?
Ans-Interface is just like a class , which contains java provides a keyword called 'implements'
Notes-
i)Interface methods are by default public & abstract.
ii)Interface method must be overrides inside then implementing classes
iii)Interface variables are by default public, static, final.
iv)Interface nothing but deals between client & developer..
